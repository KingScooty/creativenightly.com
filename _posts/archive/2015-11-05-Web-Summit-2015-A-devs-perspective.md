Web Summit 2015, Dublin, has just wrapped up. I've been here for the full duration of the conference; Monday 2nd November - Friday 6th November, and now I'm left to gather my thoughts on the week.

As a developer, I'm interested in code, data, hardware, design and UX - literally the building blocks of *anything* that makes it onto The Web.

Web Summit is described as a *conference*, some even going as far to say that it's 'the best technology conference on the planet'. It offers stages spanning the following disciplines: Code, Content, Data, Design, Enterprise, Fashion, HealthTech, Machine, Marketing, Money, Music, Night, Society, Sport, Startup University.

Sounds perfect, right?

Not quite.

The impression I got is Web Summit is *not* a conference, it's an *exhibition*. It should be named 'Startup Summit', 'Gimme some investment Summit', or even 'Pep Talks for Startup Owners Summit' - but i'll get to that bit in a minute. The halls are filled to the brim with startup booths - big and small - all vying to get their share of the investment pie. The vast majority of the booths are tiny, perhaps a metre wide, with 2-3 members aiming to sell their product to whoever will listen. As a developer attendee, I struggled to value out of this. The problem with the startup scene, is everyone and their dog wants to startup. This leads to an incredible amount of cruft. Startups that appear to be doing things that already exist, but in a slightly different way. Since 95% of all startups fail anyway, and the only reps at the booths are salesmen (not the developers that actually worked on the product!) i found it rather difficult to converse with them.

As for the talks, they are (on average) 20 minutes long, and lack substance. Most of the bulk of the talks are dumbed down for business owners / owners of startups, with the message always being, 'we did this, and so can you'. There are also a fair few slots that were simply a group of guests on a sofa simply chatting between themselves in a very 'impropmtu' setting.

There is no 'how', only 'what'.

I was expecting to *learn* something from the talks i went to, or at least come away feeling inspired. Yet nearly all the talks (excluding Brian Lile's talk from DigitalOcean) lacked substance. They were merely a way of demonstrating *what* the speaker had achieved without explaining *how* they achieved it. And of course, there was the hard sell at the end, where the speaker reveals why they're actually at the conference by taking the last 5 minutes to announce their latest book/app etc that's about to go on sale.

Niko blah, a female entrepreneur and activist, came on stage, and began to tell us how they (her group) teach kids to eavesdrop on phone conversations, turn the cameras on people's TVs, phones and computers. Things that, if she explained to the audience how to do it too, would have made her talk really, really interesting. Instead, she spends the next 20mins talking *at* the audience, telling us not to use the Wifi, not to use Facebook, not to leave an online trail, and to post fake birthday and location information to "spoil the system". I'll just lock myself away in my house and turn all electrical devices off shall i?

Price of food has been causing a bit of a stir on Twitter too. Food Summit is marketed as artisan food. €50 for the three days, or €20 per day. All you get for that is a small portion of vendor food and a bottle of water. It would have been nice to be able to socialise at the Food Summit, i was expecting a food hall with banks of benches and long tables - something akin to a Bavarian beer house, but aside from a few tiny standing tables, the only seating that's provided are park benches scattered around the park. It rained for 2/3 days, so sitting out doors wasn't really feasible, which is a shame.

Reminds me of Better call Saul, where Saul's brother thinks he's allergic to electricity and won't leave his house.


What the fuck is Rio Ferdinand doing at Web Summit? I get that this conference is trying to be *something* to all people, but when the Code, and Design stages are only running for *one* of the three days, you have to wonder, what exactly is this conference trying to achieve?

The night summit is where the real magic happens. There are some fantastic conversations to be had with people you wouldn't normally get to cross paths with. For instance, i spent a good 30 minutes talking to the Vice President of Sony Pictures about 4K, HDR video, and 3D audio - he even took my business card! But i'd argue that you don't really need a Web Summit pass to meet the tech people in the streets of Dublin.

I met Eric Migicovsky, the CEO of Pebble. He's a really humble guy, and put a note in his unreleased round Pebble to get me in touch with one of his developers.

Don't get me wrong, Web Summit *is* an impressive event. The event is rather well planned, and some of the stages are absolutely monsterous in size. It's a well oiled, mass marketed machine, and every newsletter, and every article, carefully written with hooks and a call to action to get you to buy tickets to the event. But when the entire event is filmed and put on Youtube for free [link here], and you don't necessarily need a ticket for the evening events, you have to wonder, why would anyone other than an investor, or startup owner (*sales people*) goto this event?
