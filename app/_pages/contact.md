My name is <a target="\_blank" href="http://twitter.com/kingscooty">Scotty Vernon</a>, I'm a developer and Creative Technologist based in Manchester. I run a web company called <a target="\_blank" href="http://wildflame.co.uk">Wildflame Studios</a>, and have worked with big clients like the BBC (BBC Sport, BBC R&D, BBC Homepage), Diageo, and England cricketer James Anderson. Creative Nightly is guinea pig project for practicing various front/back-end optimisation techniques, as well as a place for me to log/share my thoughts.


At the end of 2014, [I set myself a goal to write more](/2014/12/Farewell-2014-hello-2015/). Creative Nightly is the by-product of that goal. A platform for which I can record and share development notes, and share awesome things I've discovered in the world of tech. (Essentially, Creative Nightly is a log of my crusade to stay on top of the ever expanding / advancing web tech industry).
