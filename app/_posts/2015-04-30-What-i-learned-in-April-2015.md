###The good
- **Productivity on steroids**
  - This month's been a really productive one. I'm really happy with the number of topics I've managed to cover and learn. I've listed them below.
- **Docker**
  - Finally got round to learning Docker, and, wow, it's amazing. I've always had a gripe with having to use vagrant, as you need a new image for each project you work on, and that very quickly adds up. With Docker, you can spin up an instance of a base image, and add layers on top of it, meaning that resources can be shared across containers. Awesome!
- **Topics I learned about this month:**
  - [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) - Docker is an open platform for developers and sysadmins to build, ship, and run distributed applications.
  - [Redis](http://redis.io/) - High performance data persistence.
  - [TDD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development)
  - [SinonJS](http://sinonjs.org/) - Standalone test spies, stubs and mocks for JavaScript.
  - [RewireJS](https://github.com/jhnns/rewire) - Easy dependency injection for node.js unit testing.
  - [Promises](https://github.com/petkaantonov/bluebird) - Bluebird is a full featured promise library with unmatched performance.
  - Continuous delivery (CI, Docker, automation via web hooks)


###The bad
- **Slowed down on exercise**
- **Unnecessary stress**
  - Still attempting to improve by much more than 1% on the previous day. Leading to unnecessary stress.
- **Email**
  - Email has a tendency to get on top of me. That clean inbox that Dropbox Mailbox tries to force on you can get near to 100 sometimes. (It's on 140 at the moment.)
- **Not finding time to blog**
  - There's 4 or 5 articles I want to write, and that number isn't going down.
