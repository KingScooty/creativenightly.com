###The good
- **Free time**
  - After finishing up my work on the BBC Taster project, I booked some time off to have some down time, and work on my own projects, and a few R&D things for my company [Wildflame Studios](http://wildflame.co.uk).
- **Raspberry Pi 2 is released**
  - I bought 3. And they're awesome. I put a touch screen on one; made another a retro games machine; and the last, a [company bot (named Wildbot)](https://hubot.github.com/) for [Slack](http://slack.com). *(I'll try and do a write up on this at some point)*.
- **Topics I learned about this month**
  - [Async Typekit optimisation](/2015/02/Optimising-Typekit-for-mobile-devices/)
  - [Inlining critical CSS](https://github.com/addyosmani/critical)


###The bad
- **Lazy**
  - The lack of a commute means I've gotten a bit lazy again, which is a shame. I was a big fan of the morning and evening power walk across town, followed by 10 flights of stairs.
