  <p>My name is <a target="_blank" href="http://twitter.com/kingscooty">Scotty Vernon</a>, I'm a developer and creative technologist based in Manchester, England. I run a cutting edge digital prototyping company called <a target="_blank" href="http://wildflame.co.uk">Wildflame Studios</a>, and have produced work for clients including <em>BBC Sport, BBC R&amp;D, Diageo, and England cricketer James Anderson</em>.</p>

  <h3>In the beginning...</h3>
  <p>In my early teens, I was fanatical about games and special effects. Companies like <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rare_Ltd.">Rare</a> were a big inspiration. Back in the SNES and N64 days, Rare churned out at least 2 blockbusters a year, and were valuable to Nintendo's success in the 90's. These blockbusters included: Donkey Kong Country, Goldeneye, Banjo Kazooie, Jet Force Gemini, and Donkey Kong 64. They were constantly developing pioneering techniques in house, from <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donkey_Kong_Country#Development">new compression techniques to enable higher sprite fidelity at a given memory footprint</a>, to ACM (Advanced Computer Modelling, <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banjo-Kazooie#Development">to proprietary techniques to enable hi res texture rendering on the N64</a>. Rare were renowned for always <strong>pushing the boundaries and challenging technology</strong>, and this philosophy rubbed off on me from a young age.</p>


  <p>At 15 year's old - looking to make the right decisions at school - I actually wrote to Rare asking for advice on how to get a job in the industry. A few weeks later (to my surprise), I received a hand signed letter back. Granted, I was a bit too young for them to just offer me a chance to apply, but the advice within that letter stays with me to this day. Along with the programs I was advised to learn (they used 3D Studio Max and Maya in house), was this nugget of gold:</p>
 
  <blockquote><p>We typically hire based on creative talent, and <strong>not</strong> on whether you have a degree. So <strong>focus on your creativity</strong> and developing your showreel, and I'm sure we'll be hearing from you in a few years to come.</p></blockquote>

  <p>Basically, <strong>let your craft do the talking</strong>, and the work will come.</p>

  
   <!--<em>I've carried this mantra with me ever since.</em>--> <!-- This advice swayed my head from doing a creative degree that I could probably teach myself, to a technical degree that I proabably couldn't. I studied Computer Science at the University of Manchester.</p>-->

   <!-- <em>Sidenote: Even though degrees are a lot more ubiquitous these days, I still stand by this mantra. You don't need a degree to be a successful creative.</em></p> -->

  <!-- These days everyone has a degree, so I'm not sure how relevant this advice is now, but back in the late 90's / early 00's they were a bit harder to come by. -->

  <!-- <p>That letter, to this day, still guides me on my path to success. It reminds me every day that if you're talented and committed at what you do, you'll do well regardless.</p> -->

  <p>Soon after all this I stumbled across (then) Macromedia Flash and my love for hyper interactive websites was born. <a target="_blank" href="http://2advanced.com">2Advanced Studios</a> were now the new company I looked up to for creative inspiration. They constantly set higer bars for animation on The Web. I just had to get involved. I started up Wildflame Studios, which initially was merely a tag I slapped on all of my experimental learning projects, and started honing my craft.</p>

  <p>When the first draft of the HTML5 specification took the web by storm in 2008, my goal was to achieve that level of interactive fidelity in a Flash-less browser environment and the rest is history...</p>

  <h3>Creative Nightly</h3>
  
  <p>Creative Nightly is my personal blog that I plan to use to record and share development notes, and share awesome things i've discovered in the world of tech. It's essentially a bi-product of my crusade to stay on top of the ever expanding/advancing web tech industry.<!--it into a destination for creative, digital and technical explorers to consume curated content.--></p>
