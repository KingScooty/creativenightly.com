At the beginning of 2015, [I promised myself I'd get more organised](/). I coined 2015 as the year of automation and productivity, so each day this year, I've been trying to improve on the previous day by just 1%. 

###The best apps do one thing, and one thing well
The big problem with most apps is that they try to do *too much*. The best apps do *one thing*, and one thing *well*. Until recently, my iPhone suffered from serious app clutter; I had several apps installed, all competing to solve the same problem. The reason for this is partly fuelled by the fact Apple force a collection of apps on you that you can't remove, and my reluctance to pick a standard for each of the major use categories. The outcome is I ended up using none of the apps the way they were intended and often struggling to find the apps I actually wanted to use.

At the beginning of the year, I decided to lock down an app for each of the major use categories (*mail, photos, tasks, notes etc*). And remove the rest / hide the redundant Apple apps. A big requirement for me was the ability to synchonise the data in the cloud for access on multiple devices.

These are apps I've picked to do *one* thing, and one thing *well*:

- **Mail** - [Mailbox](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/mailbox/id576502633)
- **Tasks** - [Things](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/things/id284971781)
- **Photos** - [Carousel](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/carousel-by-dropbox/id825931374)
- **Notes** - [Evernote](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/evernote/id281796108)
- **Cloud** - [Dropbox](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/dropbox/id327630330)
- **Weather** - [Dark Sky](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/dark-sky-weather-radar-hyperlocal/id517329357)
- **Music** - [Spotify](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/spotify-music/id324684580)
- **Read Later** - [Pocket](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/pocket-save-articles-videos/id309601447)
- **RSS Reader** - [Flipboard](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/flipboard-your-social-news/id358801284)
- **2 Factor Auth** - [Authy](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/authy/id494168017)
- **Password Management** - [1Password](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/1password-password-manager/id568903335)

###App page organisation rules
Here are some rules I've formulated to help keep me productive when using my iPhone. 

- No more than 12 apps per page. That's 3 full rows. (I'm using an iPhone 5)
- Keep folders to a minimum on the first 2 pages. Folders aren't very visually appealling, and increase the amount of presses to get to important items. iPhones are beautiful, and so should navigating them.

#####1. What apps do you use more than 1-3 times a day?
These apps should probably go in your dock. I had a few contenders. Mailbox, Safari and Things are all apps I use fairly regularly throughout the day, and oddly, the Phone app wasn't one of them. However, I only tend to use them *during* the day, and not really in the evenings. Where as messages, socials apps, and spotify were apps I'd dip into irrespective of time. They key part of the dock mechanism is that apps are made accessible from any page you're on. 

#####2. What apps do you use at least once a day?

These apps go on the *frontpage*. Don't allow for any more than **3 rows** of apps. Less is more, plus I refuse to believe you use more than 12 apps at least once a day.

#####3. What apps do you use less than once a day, but more than once a week?


#####4. And the rest? Folders. Search is your friend!

This page isn't pretty. It's a nightmare to navigate, and not visually appealing. I have friends who's frontpages look like this! Pages like this should be reserved *only* for apps you use once in a blue moon. I think I'm going to try and clear up many of the apps on this page that I haven't used in over 2 months.


#####.5 Oh, and games go on page 4.
